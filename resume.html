            As a Resident Assistant I oversee a resident hall floor and the residents that live there for 
            the given academic year. Some main responsibilities as a Resident Assistant is to lead floor 
            meetings, be there for residents when they need help whther it be academically or personally,
            on-call shifts, and enforce the conduct policies of the University.This will be my second year 
            in this position and coming back as a returner, I had to help first-year Resident Assistants get
            acquainted and prepare them for what it is like to be a Resident Assistant.

            In high school, I would help volunteer for the LAPD Christmas Party for Abused Children that my mom's

            host carnival games, and help in breaking everything down.
