            As a Resident Assistant I oversee a resident hall floor and the residents that live there for 
            the given academic year. Some main responsibilities as a Resident Assistant is to lead floor 
            meetings, be there for residents when they need help whther it be academically or personally,
            on-call shifts, and enforce the conduct policies of the University.This will be my second year 
            in this position and coming back as a returner, I had to help first-year Resident Assistants get
            acquainted and prepare them for what it is like to be a Resident Assistant.

        <p class="long_content">
            <strong>COVID Pool Testing: </strong>Helped create a program that is able to replicate what COVID
            pool testing actually does. A quick summary of what this program does is tests to see if any of 
            the pools to test positive and if any of them do, it checks to see which sample is the odd one out 
            and the program concludes that sample is the positive test.

            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Evil Hangman: </strong> Helped create a program that is similar to regular hangman but as 
            the user inputs more and more letters the more the program will try to prevent the user from winning 
            by using or not using the letters they input in order to make them lose.

            <br>
            <strong>Tic-Tac-Toe Bot: </strong>Created a tic tac toe bot that analyzes the move of the user and 
            from that chooses the next best spot to place its own move in order to make the user lose. Other 
            versions of the bot that was created was one that places its move in the next open spot and one that 
            places its move in the corners.
